# Canonical Huffman Coding in C++

This project provides a C++ implementation of the Canonical Huffman coding algorithm. The program takes a text string as input, calculates character frequencies, builds a standard Huffman tree, derives the canonical codes, and then compresses the original text. Finally, it displays a complete report including the compression ratio, code tables, and a textual representation of the tree.
